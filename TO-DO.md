## Map/Grid

- Represents the environment where the agents interact.
- Divided into cells, each representing a different type of terrain (e.g., water, forest, urban).

## Agents

- **Citizens**: Move around, work, and interact with the environment.
- **Buildings**: Different types (e.g., houses, factories, schools) that have specific functions and affect the environment.
- **Vehicles**: Transport citizens and goods.
- **Nature Elements**: Trees, animals, water sources that impact and are impacted by human activities.

## Resources

- Energy, food, water, materials, etc.
- Managed by agents and affect the overall health of the city and environment.

## Rules and Dynamics

- Define how agents interact with each other and the environment.
- Include ecological factors such as pollution, resource depletion, and regeneration.

## Steps to Implement

### Setup the Environment

- Use `pygame` to create the main window and grid layout.

### Create Agent Classes

- Define classes for different agents like `Citizen`, `Building`, `Vehicle`, and `NatureElement`.
- Each class should have attributes and methods to interact with the environment and other agents.

### Implement Agent-Based Modelling

- Use a loop to update the state of each agent based on rules and interactions.
- Handle movement, resource consumption, production, and ecological impacts.

### Visualize the Simulation

- Use `pygame` to render the agents and the environment.
- Update the display regularly to reflect changes in the simulation.

### Add Interactivity

- Allow user input to add or remove agents, change the environment, and observe different outcomes.
